|EMAIL_USAGE|

<br>
<b>Sender</b>: The 'From' value set in the email header. This value should not be considered accurate as a sender can specify any value they wish.<br>
<b>Authentication</b>: If smtp authentication is used, this will show the login name used. Scripts will show the owner of the script. Can be considered accurate.<br>
<b>Sender Host</b>: If this is set, it will show the IP that connect to the server. If no IP is set, then the email was sent via a local script.<br>
<b>Path</b>: If the email was generated from a script, the path value will show the working directory the script was in. An email in the spool will have a path value of "retry" for each attempt.<br>
